# Mixpost Pro - VPS Installer

Single-file bash installer (`install.sh`) — provisions Ubuntu VPS and installs Mixpost Pro natively.

## Conventions

- Product name in user-facing text: **Mixpost Pro**
- Composer package: `inovector/mixpost-pro-team-app:^4.0`
- Composer auth username is the literal string `username`; password is the license key
